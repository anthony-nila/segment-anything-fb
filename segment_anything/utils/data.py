class SA1B_Dataset(torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder):
    """A data loader for the SA-1B Dataset from "Segment Anything" (SAM)

    This class inherits from :class:`~torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` so
    the same methods can be overridden to customize the dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory path.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        loader (callable, optional): A function to load an image given its path.
        is_valid_file (callable, optional): A function that takes path of an Image file
            and check if the file is a valid file (used to check of corrupt files)

     Attributes:
        classes (list): List of the class names sorted alphabetically.
        class_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (class_name, class_index).
        imgs (list): List of (image path, class_index) tuples
